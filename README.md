Dog Breed Classifier Project
by Bobby Mander

## Getting Started

The data for this project can be found below.  There are 2 datasets, one for dogs and one for human faces.

Dogs:  https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip
Humans:  https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip

The base Jupyter notebook can be found here:  https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/project-dog-classification/dog_app.ipynb

## Setup

Before executing the Jupyter Notebook using the conda_python_36 kernel, you will need to extract the dog and human data above using unzip.

Also to run the final tool you will need to copy the samples images to the top level directory.

## Libraries

A listing of libraries installed and used by the notebook is below:

1.  PyTorch:  neural network software
2.  Numpy:  computation
3.  Opencv-python:  face detection
4.  matplotlib:  display functions
5.  PIL:  image functions
6.  IPython:  display functions
